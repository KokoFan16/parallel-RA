Souffl{\'e} is being successfully used for Java security analyses at Oracle Labs due to (1) its high-performance, (2) support for rapid program analysis development, and (3) customizability. Souffl{\'e} incorporates the highly flexible Datalog-based program analysis paradigm while exhibiting performance results that are on-par with manually developed state-of-the-art tools. In this tool paper, we introduce the Souffl{\'e} architecture, usage and demonstrate its applicability for large-scale code analysis on the OpenJDK7 library as a use case.",
