This section discusses implementing relational algebra efficiently and in parallel. We take a hybrid approach of nesting key-value stores within a hash-table that can be partitioned across multiple cores or nodes. 


\subsection{Representations}

First, we review the two main approaches to encoding relations in a way that is amenable to fast RA algorithms. Unsurprisingly, algorithms for computing join, union, selection, etc, depend greatly on the representation used for relations themselves.

\paragraph{Key-value stores} Another approach to encoding relations is to use a hash table, B-tree, prefix tree (trie), or other key-value store.


\subsection{Hybrid hash-tree join}

Our approach is to
