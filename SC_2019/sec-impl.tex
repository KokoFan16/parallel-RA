\label{sec:impl}
%
This section discusses our implementation of efficient distributed relational algebra. We employ a hybrid approach we call \emph{Hash-Tree} RA that consists of nesting B-tree key-value stores within a hash-table that can be partitioned across multiple cores or MPI nodes. Like the double-hashing approach 



\paragraph{Hybrid hash-table and b-tree} Our approach is to use an efficient key-value store, but to
