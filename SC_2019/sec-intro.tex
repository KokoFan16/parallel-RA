-- What is RA \\
-- Why RA at scale ? \\
-- What are the challenges to do RA at scale ? \\
-- How is our approach solving these problems ?

Today's supercomputers have very high speed interconnects, data can be transmitted between processes with very low latency. 
When used under the right configuration, all to all communication which is known to be the most intensive mode of communication can also scale very well.
We demonstrate how for a particular workload (graph size) we can identify the correct scale at which we can scale all to all communication

In particular, following are our key contributions:
\begin{tightenumerate}
	\item We present a novel hybrid hash-tree based algorithm for distributed unions and joins.
	\item We present scalable impelemtation of fixed point algorithm transitive closure.
	\item We demonstrate scalability of transitive closure till 65536 processes, producing a graph with upwards of 260 billion edges. 
\end{tightenumerate}

As per our knowledge this is the first fully scalable implementation of Relational algebra.
